Q: addition of two numbers

Covers:
1) regular expressions
2) function

Sol:
#!/bin/bash

# Adding two numbers

#Defining regular expression to match only numbers
re="^[0-9]+$"

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <number1> <number2>"
    exit 1
fi

function sum {
    total=$(( $1 + $2 ))
}


#This Bash conditional checks whether both the first (`$1`) and second (`$2`) 
#command-line arguments match a regular expression pattern stored in the variable `$re`. 
#The `[[ ... ]]` is Bashâ€™s advanced test command, and the `=~` operator is used for regular 
#expression matching. 
if [[ $1 =~ $re && $2 =~ $re ]]; then
    sum $1 $2
    echo "Sum of $1 and $2 is: $total"
else
    echo "Both arguments must be numbers."
    exit 1
fi
